Cartopy
=======

Cartopy is a library, written in python, which utilises the power of Proj.4 in a pythonic way. The simplicity of the interface to Proj.4 is extended in order to build maps easily with Matplotlib.


.. note:: Cartopy is not currently operational. If you wish to contribute to this project, please get in touch. Alternatively, the Basemap extension to matplotlib is a finished package with a subset of the functionality planned for cartopy.
